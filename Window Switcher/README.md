# Window Switcher
This script attempts to mimic the behaviour of the Mac function ``cmd + ` `` and ``cmd + shift + ` `` which cycles through windows running the same application.

## Installation
1. Download `Window Switcher.ahk`
2. Run with Auto Hotkey Version 2

### Suggestion
Create a shortcut to the script and add it into your start up folder so the script runs on boot

Startup folder can be found in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

## Usage
``alt + ` `` to cycle forwards through windows

``alt + shift + ` `` to cycle backwards through windows
